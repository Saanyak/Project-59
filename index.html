        <p>I love Arts and Crafts. In arts and Crafts you can become creative and do lots of different things. In Arts and Crafts, you can do things like coloring and making things out of paper, cardboard, and lots more. My favorite thing to color is flowers. I also like to make things with paper, I have made paper backpack and its small. The paper backpack was my favorite thing to make. If you want to learn to make things out of paper or color things, you should check out this youtuber named Tonni Art and Craft, I learned arts and crafts from her and I bet you can too. Finally, Arts and Crafts is my favorite hobby.</p>
